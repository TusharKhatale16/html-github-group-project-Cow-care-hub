        <h3>Health check guidance</h3>
        Health check guidance focuses on regular monitoring of a cow’s physical condition and behavior. By observing eating habits, movement, milk production, and general activity, cow owners can identify early signs of illness. Regular health checks help in early detection of problems and reduce the chances of severe diseases. This practice supports long-term cow health and well-being.

        <h3>Nutrition support</h3>
        Nutrition support provides information on proper feeding practices based on the cow’s age, breed, and purpose. A balanced diet that includes green fodder, dry fodder, clean water, and essential nutrients is necessary for good health. Proper nutrition helps improve immunity, growth, and milk production, ensuring better productivity and care.
